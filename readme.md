Furthermore, this project is committed to the principles of openness and collaboration. To reflect this ethos, it employs the Unlicense, a permissive open-source license that promotes absolute freedom in using the software. The Unlicense allows for maximum flexibility, enabling users to copy, modify, and distribute the code without any restrictions or requirements.

This approach fosters a sense of shared ownership, encouraging contributions from the community and fostering an environment where innovation thrives unhindered. The use of the Unlicense underscores the project's dedication to open collaboration and the spirit of giving back to the development community.
